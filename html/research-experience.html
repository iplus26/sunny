                            <li>Performed analysis on 5 years of water usage data and designed a distributed system, including measurement, data transmission method, and feedback control, to optimize water use management based on real-time data. Carried out a pilot scheme that would help save DUT 500,000 CNY annually and developed an informational Android application. </li>
                            <li>Introduced a water right trade algorithm and platform based on water usage data from a hopsital that would improve Dalian city’s water management system and reduce water usage by an estimated 8%. </li>
