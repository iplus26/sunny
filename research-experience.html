<p>I am now interested in the control aspect of Cyber-Physical Systems and tend to work inter-disciplinary to make control systems beneficial to different fields.</p>

9.2016 ～ Present

Dalian University of Technology Mentor: Prof. Xi-Ming Sun
Trying to view aero-engine as a Cyber-Physical System and improve real-time control for it.

3.2016 ～ Present

Dalian University of Technology Mentor: Prof. Chi Zhang
Funded by the National College Students' Innovative Training Program of China
-   Carried out a pilot scheme and designed a distributed system to optimize water use management in DUT.
-   Introduced a water right trade algorithm and a platform based on numerous data to improve water management system for Dalian city.



7.2016 ～ 9.2016

Advanced Integrated Cyber-Physical Systems (AICPS) Lab 
University of California, Irvine    Mentor: Prof. Mohammad Al Faruque                                                                                                                        
-   A 10-week summer research.
-   Designed experimental approaches and set up Battery Testbed for SOC estimation and internal resistance calculation for battery packs.
-   Found out useful results after rough data processing.



11.2014 ~ 3.2016         

Dalian University of Technology Mentor: Prof. Quihui Pan
Funded by the National College Students' Innovative Training Program of China
-   Accomplished the research on the prey-predator systems.
-   Built an ecosystem model and simulation applied Cellular Automata to explore the tendency of prey- predator systems influenced by distribution and quantity of water resource.
